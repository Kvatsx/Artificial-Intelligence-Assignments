   :synopsis: pygame module for clipboard support.

| :sl:`pygame module for clipboard support.`

EXPERIMENTAL!: meaning this API may change, or disappear in later pygame
releases. If you use this, your code will break with the next pygame release.

The scrap module is for getting and putting stuff from the clipboard. So you
can copy and paste things between pygame, and other application types. It
defines some basic own data types

::

  SCRAP_PPM
  SCRAP_PBM
  SCRAP_BMP
  SCRAP_TEXT

to be placed into the clipboard and allows to use define own clipboard types.
``SCRAP_PPM``, ``SCRAP_PBM`` and ``SCRAP_BMP`` are suitable for surface buffers
to be shared with other applications, while ``SCRAP_TEXT`` is an alias for the
plain text clipboard type.

The SCRAP_* types refer to the following ``MIME`` types and register those as
well as the default operating system type for this type of data:

::

  SCRAP_TEXT text/plain    for plain text
  SCRAP_PBM  image/pbm     for PBM encoded image data
  SCRAP_PPM  image/ppm     for PPM encoded image data
  SCRAP_BMP  image/bmp     for BMP encoded image data

Depending on the platform additional types are automatically registered when
data is placed into the clipboard to guarantee a consistent sharing behaviour
with other applications. The following listed types can be used as string to be
passed to the respective :mod:`pygame.scrap` module functions.

For Windows platforms, the additional types are supported automatically and
resolve to their internal definitions:

::

  text/plain;charset=utf-8 for UTF-8 encoded text
  audio/wav                for WAV encoded audio
  image/tiff               for TIFF encoded image data

For ``X11`` platforms, the additional types are supported automatically and
resolve to their internal definitions:

::

  UTF8_STRING               for UTF-8 encoded text
  text/plain;charset=utf-8  for UTF-8 encoded text
  COMPOUND_TEXT             for COMPOUND text

As stated before you can define own types for the clipboard, those however
might not be usable by other applications. Thus data pasted into the clipboard
using

::

  pygame.scrap.put ("own_data", data)

can only be used by applications, which query the clipboard for the "own_data"
type.

New in pygame 1.8. Only works for Windows, ``X11`` and Mac ``OS`` ``X`` so far.
On Mac ``OSX`` only text works at the moment - other types will be supported in
the next release.

.. function:: init

   | :sl:`Initializes the scrap module.`
   | :sg:`init () -> None`

   Tries to initialize the scrap module and raises an exception, if it fails.
   Note that this module requires a set display surface, so you have to make
   sure, you acquired one earlier using ``pygame.display.set_mode()``.

   .. ## pygame.scrap.init ##

.. function:: get

   | :sl:`Gets the data for the specified type from the clipboard.`
   | :sg:`get (type) -> bytes`

   Returns the data for the specified type from the clipboard. The data is
   returned as a byte string and might need further processing,
   such as decoding to Unicode.
   If no data for the passed type is available, None is returned.

   ::

     text = pygame.scrap.get (SCRAP_TEXT)
     if text:
         # Do stuff with it.
     else:
         print "There does not seem to be text in the clipboard."

   .. ## pygame.scrap.get ##

.. function:: get_types

   | :sl:`Gets a list of the available clipboard types.`
   | :sg:`get_types () -> list`

   Gets a list of strings with the identifiers for the available clipboard
   types. Each identifier can be used in the ``scrap.get()`` method to get the
   clipboard content of the specific type. If there is no data in the
   clipboard, an empty list is returned.

   ::

     types = pygame.scrap.get_types ()
     for t in types:
         if "text" in t:
             # There is some content with the word "text" in it. It's
             # possibly text, so print it.
             print pygame.scrap.get (t)

   .. ## pygame.scrap.get_types ##

.. function:: put

   | :sl:`Places data into the clipboard.`
   | :sg:`put(type, data) -> None`

   Places data for a specific clipboard type into the clipboard. The data must
   be a string buffer. The type is a string identifying the type of data placed
   into the clipboard. This can be one of the native ``SCRAP_PBM``,
   ``SCRAP_PPM``, ``SCRAP_BMP`` or ``SCRAP_TEXT`` values or an own string
   identifier.

   The method raises an exception, if the content could not be placed into the
   clipboard.

   ::

     fp = open ("example.bmp", "rb")
     pygame.scrap.put (SCRAP_BMP, fp.read ())
     fp.close ()
     # Now you can acquire the image data from the clipboard in other
     # applications.
     pygame.scrap.put (SCRAP_TEXT, "A text to copy")
     pygame.scrap.put ("Plain text", "A text to copy")

   .. ## pygame.scrap.put ##

.. function:: contains

   | :sl:`Checks, whether a certain type is available in the clipboard.`
   | :sg:`contains (type) -> bool`

   Returns True, if data for the passed type is available in the clipboard,
   False otherwise.

   ::

     if pygame.scrap.contains (SCRAP_TEXT):
         print "There is text in the clipboard."
     if pygame.scrap.contains ("own_data_type"):
         print "There is stuff in the clipboard."

   .. ## pygame.scrap.contains ##

.. function:: lost

   | :sl:`Checks whether the clipboard is currently owned by the application.`
   | :sg:`lost() -> bool`

   Returns True, if the clipboard is currently owned by the pygame application,
   False otherwise.

   ::

     if pygame.scrap.lost ():
        print "No content from me anymore. The clipboard is used by someone else."

   .. ## pygame.scrap.lost ##

.. function:: set_mode

   | :sl:`Sets the clipboard access mode.`
   | :sg:`set_mode(mode) -> None`

   Sets the access mode for the clipboard. This is only of interest for ``X11``
   environments, where clipboard modes for mouse selections (SRAP_SELECTION)
   and the clipboard (SCRAP_CLIPBOARD) are available. Setting the mode to
   ``SCRAP_SELECTION`` in other environments will not cause any difference.

   If a value different from ``SCRAP_CLIPBOARD`` or ``SCRAP_SELECTION`` is
   passed, a ValueError will be raised.
